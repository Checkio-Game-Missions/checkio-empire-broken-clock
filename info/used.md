**How it is used:**

Believe it or not, this mission is teaching you some of the same principles used in GPS tracking.
Because the satellites in orbit are moving so fast, we need to account for relativity.
So, when we factor in the speed of the satellite, we can figure out the difference from
the time on the ground and write a program to compensate.
