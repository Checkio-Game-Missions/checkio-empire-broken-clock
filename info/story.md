We have a broken clock. We know how quickly it runs or lags over a specific period of time.
At first, the clock is set to the correct time, but after a while it begins
to display an incorrect time... But instead of correcting the clock each time, 
we will use an algorithm to calculate the correct time by accounting for 
the difference compared to the actual current time. Of course we will have access to 
the correct time for each day. In addition, you can be certain that 
the correct starting time and current actual time fall on the same day. 
For this mission, time is measured in a 24 hour format.
